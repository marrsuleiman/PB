Welcome to my little slice of the internet, where I will be sharing my thoughts, opinions, and the lessons I have learned about careers and employment. I hope someone will read my thoughts and learn from my mistakes and successes. I might occasionally throw in some opinions about things outside the scope of my career if I think it's worth sharing. 

I live in London with my partner and our house plants. I refuse to get on the tube unless I have a book with me or an audiobook ready to go. As a writer, I am interested in sharing my thoughts in easy-to-understand language. As a technical writer, I am interested in the same thing, easy-to-understand documentation that won't put people off wanting to use products. 

I am very excited about sharing my thoughts on this blog because I am using Jekyll. I could have used one of the many free website builders available on the internet, but I like to learn new things, so this is an opportunity to learn something new. 

It will be *pretty basic* in terms of design until I figure out how to make it prettier. So bear with me. But until then, I hope you enjoy reading what I have to say.
